# BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1

This is my website. Created thanks to RR Course BaSP 2022

## Folder Structure

There are different folders for each week of the bootcamp. The description for each week will be attached below.
Please keep in mind that there is a 1 week difference as the "true" first week was the Figma screenflow. So "Week 1" is actually "Week 2".

### Semana 1

The first week's objective is to recreate the landing website created in Figma the first week of the bootcamp.

### Semana 2

This week's objective is to add style to the HTML create before. You can find the CSS code in the "style.css" file.

Thanks for reading!
